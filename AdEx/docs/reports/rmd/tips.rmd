## CODE: Fast prototipying in code (2021-12-27)
One of my biggest mistakes is to try to build, at first, a very complicated piece of software, which is amendable
for programmer, but also efficient as hell. **I must focus on building a working piece of software and then improve
it!**

## CODE: git store credential

general formula:

```bash
// local
git config credential.helper store
// global
git config --global credential.helper store
```

```bash
$ git config credential.helper store
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
Username: <type your username>
Password: <type your password>
```

Notice that **Password** is the code obtained from the [github access token](https://docs.github.com/es/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

```bash
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
[your credentials are used automatically]
```
