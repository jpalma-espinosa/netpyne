# Introduction

In the brain, the physical connections between different anatomic regions defines what is known as connectome, which is better represented by the  Structural Connectivity (SC) [@sporns2005human]. The SC is a matrix that represents wheter a brain area $x$ is structurally connected, via axonal fibers, to another brain region $y$. Those connections may be observed by mapping the axonal fibers bundles that link different anatomical areas, through imaging techniques, such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging, DTI-MRI [@fornito2015connectomics].  

Additionally, activity measurements done in different brain areas by different techniques (see reviews for Magneto/Electro Encephalogram [@da2013eeg] or functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) [@van2010exploring]), revealed that each anatomic region has its own dynamical activity. 

Studies on pairwise correlation between signals of different brain areas, revealed subnetworks of highly stable and synchronized activity. These patterns of synchronized and desynchronized areas form what is known as Functional Connectivity(FC). 

Thus, an open question is how brain structrure relates with brain dynamics, or viceversa. Therefore, it has been hypothetized that the structural connectivity constrains the brain dynamics [@sporns2005human], by imposing a particular topology driven primarly by brain metabolism and physical constraints on the craneum [@bullmore2012economy;@kaiser2011tutorial;@lynn2019physics]. This hypothesis has been supported by later studies, which established links between SC and FC.  For example, Honey showed that the spatial statistics of FC can be related to the SC [@honey2009predicting]. Also, it has been shown that there is a strong relationship between the subnetworks found in FC and structural subnetworks observed in SC [@diez2015novel;@honey2007network]. 

The previous hypothesis has been partially supported by studies on the SC-FC relationship, however correlation exhibited by FC is not static, but varies in time, transiting between a number of ``states'' with spatio-temporal characteristics, defining a particular dynamical regime, known as Functional Connectivity Dynamics (FCD) [@hansen2015functional], thus opening again the question on how the brain structure supports a broad range of evolving dynamical activity, exhibited by FCD.

The nature of these relationship has been studied intensively at local (cortical areas), or mesoscale (coupling between areas), proposing mechanisms that could explain the observed FCD.

At local scale, changes in the dynamics of cortical areas have been proposed as a mechanism that could explain the FCD. For example, the stochastic opening and closing of ionic channels, move the stable operating point of brain activity to another one, allowing the system to explore different stable points [@berglund2010stochastic;@heitmann2018putting]. This mechanism has been reported as a key element in the emergence of brain states reported in FCD [@orio2018chaos]. 
On the other hand, chaotic behavior in brain activity is also related to ``dynamical wandering'' between states.  In this type of dynamic regime, chaos acts also as a promoter of what is known as multistable behavior, allowing the system to visit other stable or quasi-stable states [@xu2018synchronization].
Finally, structural coupling between subnetworks has been also shown to drive FCD [@heitmann2018putting], by imposing an oscillatory regime derived by the interconnections within brain areas [@cabral2014exploring;@orio2018chaos].

At  mesoscale, coupling [@deco2009key;@deco2012ongoing] and delay between nodes [@deco2009key, cabral2014exploring] have been suggested as mechanisms that could drive the system to different states.
Altogether, these mechanisms serve as the basis for understanding the emergence of FCD by changes in local circuits and subnetworks.

However, the relationship between FCD and the network structure has remained elusive at the macroscale level. Though some of the studies have established a causal link between a given structure and its associated FCD [@batista2018we;@honey2009predicting], a systematic exploration of the relationship between global structural connectivity and FCD is needed.

# Methods

## Network Models
Networks with different topologies were generated by using Barabasi-Alberts, Watts-Strogatz, or custom Hierarchical-model algorithms [@watts1998collective].  

## Segregation and integration metrics
For analyzing the segregation and integration properties of the networks, efficiency [@rubinov2010complex], transitivity [@rubinov2010complex], and newtwork modulariy [@newman2004fast] metrics were calculated, by using the brain connectivity toolbox for Python _bctp_ (https://pypi.org/project/bctpy/).  Calculation of each metric, and its definitions, may be found in the Supplementary Information.

# Results

First, to characterize the degree at which each network is integrated and segregated at the same time, i.e., how "small-worldiness" it is, $\omega$ metric was calculated for each network.
